# 1) How do I get these to group into 3 cluster jobs?

# $ snakemake --groups a_cluster_job=group_cluster_job --group-components group_cluster_job=10
# I'll make a profile to test with. If this works I'll make a profile making script.

# Hmm this allocates parallel jobs with 10 cores.

# 2) Within the grouped job, do the jobs run in serial or parallel?

# I can force it. It's a bit ugly but it works.
