#   {upstream_host} - eg prom@promethion
#   {upstream_path} - eg /data/testrun
#   {cell}          - col 3 - eg. testlib/20190710_1723_2-A5-D5_PAD38578_c6ded78b

# SYNC_CMD="ssh \${upstream_host} rsync -vrlptDR \${upstream_path}/./\${cell} /mnt/lustre/prometion/prom_runs/\${run}/"

# If you want different sync commands for different upstream hosts then this is not yet supported.
# I'm imaginging if we get another Promethion we'll just set it up the same.
