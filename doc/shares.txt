Duncan had already mounted a /lustre share on the promethion machine. It's CIFS and a bit meh.

I moved it to /mnt at least.

I also added a new volume on FluidFS, having expanded the storage as per:

(Pretty simple - you type in a number and it adds volumes and assigns them to Purple, but you can't shrink so beware)

So now maybe we can write direct to fluid and pull from there? Simplifies things!
