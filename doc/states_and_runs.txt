The first job of the pipeline is to get the data off the machine and onto /fluidfs and /lustre.

This is tricky, as the promised auto-sync is not yet available, and we're not sure how to detect that
a run is finished, nor how to query the internal database. Looking on the machine:

In /data we have directories that may be named per run or maybe per project? Need to
see what happens when a duplicate name is specified. In general we need to see how the
info entered by Marion maps to the file/dir naming convention like:

20190614_11685BN/11685BN0004L01/20190614_1558_2-E1-H1_PAD48914_88421642/fast5_pass

Looks like:

run/library/flowcell

Are any of those dates auto-generated?

The run name is arbitrary. But the date is auto-coded into the start of the flowcell name.
Could I synthesize a run name like:

1) Take the date of the first flowcell.
2) If the run name starts with {date}_ then return run_name
   Else return {date}_run_name

Is 2-E1-H1 the slot number?
Is PAD48914 the flowcell ID?
What's that final number? Just a hash?

Does the final_summary.txt actually appear after everything else, or does it appear
gradually? If the latter, we can use it to detect a new dataset to process (yay).
If not, we may still be able to detect when it grows to 17 lines.

But why is this only for some runs? Is it brought by a software update?

We have a "sequencing_summary" file. Per flowcell. These are big. Again are they written on-the-fly?

Does it make sense to talk about "a run" at all? Does it make sense to talk about a run starting
and finishing? It seems that a run can be stopped and then restarted, in which case...

The idea of a run, as per SMRTino, could be a red herring. Maybe we have runs as placeholders
but they are just open-ended and collect new flowcells?

Run start:

A run is new when it has any flowcell directory. Generate the name and make a (very) initial
report. Monitor for events which may be:

Flowcell added

Log the new flowcell and update the report

Flowcell complete

Start processing and at the end make the report
If all flowcells are complete, notify RT - so then a run "finishes" when the number complete == number added, but there could still be more to come.

We need to resolve the fact that new cells could (I think) appear as old ones are processing.
SMRTino already deals with multiple cells finishing at once, but...

When is it safe to remove a run? How was Urmi doing that? Manual, automatic, special procedure?
Can the script safely purge old runs? Or how about it logs the ones it would like to purge, then
there is a script on the machine to actually do it? Sounds better!
