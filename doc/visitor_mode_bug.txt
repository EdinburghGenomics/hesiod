So with visitor deliveries, I had the bright idea to move, rather than copy, the
cell directory.

The problem with this is that run_status.py no longer sees that the cell is synced
and adds the run to the sync queue. Now when it actually goes to sync, nothing
happens because the .synced file is detected. But it should have been detected
earlier, by run_status.py.

Let's make a test case, based on 20231010_MIN2_v_ctang2_run2_20231010.

$ ./run_status.py -I test/examples/visitor_runs/20231010_MIN2_v_jschmoe2_delivered <<<$'20231010_MIN2_v_jschmoe2_delivered\tfoo\tsample1/20231010_1042_MN32284_APO469_7e31b9d5'

This shows as "sync_needed" but the cell should be marked as "done".

I think I can live with cells that only have a ".synced" touch file being detected here, but the ".done"
should be respected. Make this a test case and fix the bug.
