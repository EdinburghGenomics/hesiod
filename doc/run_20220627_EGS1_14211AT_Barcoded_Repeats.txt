In this run we have a puzzling error. The call:

SC, COUNTS = scan_cells(EXPDIR, config)

is failing because load_final_summary() is getting called with a junk input value:

rundata/14211ATpool01_79_87_94/20220627_1339_2-E11-H11_PAK11505_525faab8\t14211ATpool02_86_88_95/20220627_1339_2-E5-H5_PAK11504_fa381a04/

I think what's happening is that the tab character in --config cells='...' is being replaced by r'\t' - ie. a backlash and a letter 't'.

One though is that the Snakefile should not need to calculate all of these for every cluster job, but there is no elegant way to prevent
this. (Actually there may be, using a checkpoint rule or a pre-run script to build SC, but I'll leave that for now).

I think I should be able to fix the config to get rid of the tab char. Let me see..
