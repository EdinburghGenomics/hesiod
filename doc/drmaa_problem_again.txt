The DRMAA problem has come back, where sometimes SLURM thinks the job has failed but actually it's a timeout getting the status.
Last time I ended up patching the DRMAA code. I may have to do this again.

Link to my bug report on DRMAA?
Line in the Snakemake code where the DRMAA response is processed?

Plan to sort this:

1) Make a Snakemake pipeline that generates lots of jobs at once, then each job writes 1GB of random data, compresses it,
   decompresses it, whatever. Takes about 3 mins.
2) Run and re-run until it fails
3) Modify Snakemake to dump the DRMAA response
4) Take it from there

Ach. This will take a while.
