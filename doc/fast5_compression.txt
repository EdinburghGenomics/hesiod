Compressing the .fast5 files used to be worth it, but now the space saving is only 1 or 2%
So let's not bother any more.

But what is the better option?

Leave them in place, in prom_runs? But then I can't delete the prom_run directory because it
has important data.

Move the files across? No this breaks the idea of prom_run being synced, because next time the sync
is run it will put the files back.

OK lets's hard-link. It's a minimal change to my existing logic. I still need to md5sum the files in
any case.

Need to make sure that delivery still works with .fast5 vs .fast5.gz

Nope there are problems. See fast5_linkable_perms.txt.
