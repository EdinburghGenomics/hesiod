After upgrading Snakemake to version 7.18.2 I discovered and submitted this bug report:

https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/1968

* But I've patched it so we're OK

There is also this one:

https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/1976

* But we can avoid it by not using '--'

But more importantly this one!:

https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/2011

* But I think we can avoid this by using '--drop-metadata' - and maybe speed
things up a little too.

And this other one:

https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/issues/2015

* But Paul supplied a patch I can use
