I think I'll put an Easter egg in the reports.

# JQuery makes it easy to detect mouse movement...

$("body").mousemove(function(e) {
    console.log(e.pageX + " , " + e.pageY);
    })

I'd suggest that if the mouse pointer is moved to the top corner (e.pageY <= 3 and e.pageY <= 3 )
then a hidden div becomes visible and slowly moves down, then back up again.

The div starts at 80%, -20.

It ends at Y=120, then pauses for 1 sec, then returns, then vanishes

If the mouse moves away, it goes into reverse mode immediately

Once return has started, it does not stop and the div will never reappear

OK, I can code that.

Or how about if the mouse is within the Hesiod text?

$("p.subtitle").mousemove(function(e) {
    console.log(e.offsetX + " , " + e.offsetY);
    })

I can use that to see if X is less than 10. Conversely if the mouse goes outside
this area OR if it leaves the subtitle entirely I start the return cycle and cancel all
the listeners. Yup.
