After adding the ability to process barcoded runs, the report is a mess.

What to do? The tables are aggregated by project but have one row per barcode.

Ideally I'd have a view like we see with Illuminatus - ie. the fastqscreen output.
Potentially I could import the JavaScript and make the plot, but making this work with
PanDoc will make an unholy mess. Won't it?

And I should have a dropdown so you can select phylum/order/species - again that means
more JavaScript. Or else I could make it a selector like for % vs counts? But the %
mode makes no sense when everything is downsampled to 10k.

Yeah, we'll shelve this for now. Make the histogram as that's most useful. But my choice of
graphing library should be in accord with the idea above. Grrr.

OK, let's get the delivery sorted first and then come back to it.
