In production, Hesiod fastidiously records which version of the pipeline is running
and bakes into reports. Inspired by MultiQC I've made it so that the development version
now logs the actual GIT commit as well as the contents of version.txt.

If a new release has just been tagged then then version will be reported without
any embellishment.
