The files in prom_runs will build up fast. I think it makes sense to remove them once
the files are packed, tarred and md5summed. The directory itself needs to be left in place
(ie. at least the pipeline bit) so that it will not be re-synced.

Will this upset Snakemake that source files have vanished? Maybe, but we can easily fix that.

As for deletion from prom:/data, assuming we continue writing there, I think we should push
a list of runs to delete. Then there will be a desktop icon to actually do the deletion.
Yes.
