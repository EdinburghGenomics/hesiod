Snakemake is slow.

Is there any way to work out what it's doing?

And maybe speed it up?

Probably not, but I can try, right?

My main idea is that if it's writing a bunch of files I can force them onto a tmpfs file system.

...

OK, running `stat()` on every input file is definitely a big slowdown. Perhaps I can fudge Snakemake so
that if the files are "ancient()" it will skip this part. Maybe? I mean, let's give it a go.

I don't think the times are very useful to me in the context of this pipeline since we almost always assume
that all the files are there before we start.
