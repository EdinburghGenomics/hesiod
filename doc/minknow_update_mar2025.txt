After the MinKNOW update we have a minor issue with the POD5 files. Had to manually
make md5sums and add the files to the delivery for:

/lustre-gseg/transfer/36420_Schoenebeck_Jeffrey/raw_data/20250401/all_pod5/20250327_EGS2_36420SJpool02_36420SJpool02_PBC54922_cc49acdf/

The change is that there are now no basecalls for the failed reads, and so the POD5 for these goes into pod5_skip.

But it looks like this is an option that can be turened off, in which case the normal behaviour is observed.
So I'm not sure we actually want to fix it?

If we do want to support the new behaviour then:

1) We should deliver POD5 files in pod5 and pod5_skip directories rather than moving them around
2) We need to make sure everything is md5summed
3) (Actually most importantly) we need to work out how this operates with barcodes

Aye.
