Duplex basecalling.

Is new and slightly janky.

There are scripts at:

https://github.com/nanoporetech/duplex-tools

These seem to run reasonably fast. I can use them to get an estimate of the number of duplex reads and
add this number to the report. Also the two pair lists (filtered and unfiltered) will be available if
we then decide to do duplex basecalling. It seems there are a very few fasle positives but the estimate
should be pretty close - remember to be clear when reporting the number if you are giving the number of
raw reads or the number of pairs.

Duplex basecalling is another matter. It seems we can do it on Cirrus GPU nodes if we were to negotiate
access, but I need to do some tuning to make it reasonably fast.

Anyway, let's add duplex-tools to Hesiod...

duplex_tools==0.2.11

Installs fine in the VEnv - adds a couple of extra deps which is fine

There are two steps to run. The first makes pair_ids.txt and the next makes pair_ids_filtered.txt
The first step depends on sequencing_summary.txt
The second depends on the result of the first plus the FASTQ directory

Should be easy enough to Snakemake this, and add something to the report.
