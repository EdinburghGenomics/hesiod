I'm so dumb. I made the Hesiod pipeline create batched pod5 files with the .pod extension.
Of course, Dorado ignores them.

I need to fix the runs I made, so:

1) Test on ~/test_promethion/fastqdata/20231107_MIN2_26171SS

* Check the md5sums
* Remove the existing pod5_._fail and pod5_._pass directories
* And the ones from md5sums too
* Re-run the pipeline
* Any more prodding needed?? No
* Check the md5sums again - ok
* Check that Dorado will read the files now - seems so

2) And then release new Hesiod and repeat for the actual runs:

20240124_EGS2_27971RLpool01
20240125_EGS2_27971RLpool01_Run2
20240126_EGS2_27971RLpool01_Run3
20240125_EGS2_29490KG

---

OK this is fine, and I confirmed that running Dorado on the batched-up POD5 files produces the same result.
However, I should really modify my code so that the original prefix of the POD5 files gets included in the
batched file names. So for example files like:

PAS24884_fail_barcode11_64b522fc_6e8790f5_1.pod5

should be batched into:

PAS24884_fail_barcode11_64b522fc_6e8790f5_batch100_00000000.pod5

Not simply:
batch100_00000000.pod5

I'll sort this out later, once auto-delivery is back.
