I'm so dumb. I made the Hesiod pipeline create batched pod5 files with the .pod extension.
Of course, Dorado ignores them.

I need to fix the runs I made, so:

1) Test on ~/test_promethion/fastqdata/20231107_MIN2_26171SS

* Check the md5sums
* Remove the existing pod5_._fail and pod5_._pass directories
* And the ones from md5sums too
* Re-run the pipeline
* Any more prodding needed?? No
* Check the md5sums again - ok
* Check that Dorado will read the files now - seems so

2) And then release new Hesiod and repeat for the actual runs:

20240124_EGS2_27971RLpool01
20240125_EGS2_27971RLpool01_Run2
20240126_EGS2_27971RLpool01_Run3
20240125_EGS2_29490KG

OK this is fine, and I confirmed that running Dorado on the batched-up POD5 files produces the same result.
However, I should really modify my code so that the original prefix of the POD5 files gets included in the
batched file names. So for example files like:

PAS24884_fail_barcode11_64b522fc_6e8790f5_1.pod5

should be batched into:

PAS24884_fail_barcode11_64b522fc_6e8790f5_batch100_00000000.pod5

Not simply:
batch100_00000000.pod5

I'll sort this out later, once auto-delivery is back.

May 2024. So ONT have finally fixed the batching of the POD5 files themselves. Now I just need
to copy the files and md5sum them. So I can rip out all the batching logic and just replicate
what I previously had for fast5. Well I guess that was a waste of my time after all. I'll get
that sorted when I can.

(Friday 2nd)
It's working and has made a test report. Let us check:

1) Does the report look OK (Did I ever report the total number of POD5 files)?

Yes it does.
Snakefile.main get_cell_info() sets ci['Files in pod5'] and this gets saved into
cell_info.yaml. Here "Files in pod5: 73" which disregards the skipped files and is not
the same as "pod5_files_in_final_dest: 75" in the final summary. I think this is OK.
I'll add this to the report.

2) Are all the POD5 files there?
   With the md5sums? - yes, need to make individual files temp
   What about the _pass and _fail? - not there
   What about the _skip? - not there

3) Do the POD5 files segragate by channel? Would be cool if they did.

$ pod5 view pod5_file.pod5 -i "read_id,channel"

No such luck.

4) Data delivery needs testing, and inevitably fixing.

I'll release and run the code first.
