I now (29/7) have Hesiod making a nice report, so before showing it around what do I want
to fix?

1) Ensure it's uploaded to web1
2) Fix the Blob plots which are not linked - done
3) Add overall plots from MinionQC
4) Add some plots from Nanoplot into the main report - done
5) Fix the date format - done
6) Check start times are actually being recorded - done
7) Add NanoStats - done
8) Fix order of cells - done
