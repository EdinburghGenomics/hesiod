I implemented a mechanism to name samples on a run but it's not much use without
documentation. So here's the doc:

---

When Hesiod encounters a barcoded ONT flowcell, typically there will be some barcodes
with many reads, some with a few (mis-assigned) reads and some with no reads at all.

To make for a tidy report, the default behaviour of Hesiod is to apply a cutoff and
ignore the barcodes with very few reads. This is not ideal as we want to specify
exactly what is in the pool as well as naming the samples with our own names, rather
than barcodeXX.

First, you will need a TSV file with three columns:

Barcode   Library_ID   Sample_Name

eg.

barcode01  23920AT0001  HeLa

You do not need a header line on the file. You need to give the file a name which connects
it to the run and you have several naming options:

  * `12345XX_sample_names.tsv` will be applied to experiment, say, 20210520_EGS1_12345XX
  * `12345_sample_names.tsv` will be applied to any cells for project 12345
  * `PAG12345_sample_names.tsv` will apply to the given flowcell barcode
  * `12345XXpool01` will apply to the pool, as entered into MinKNOW

And you need to put the file into `/lustre-gseg/promethion/sample_names` or whatever directory
is set to SAMPLE_NAMES_DIR in the Hesiod config. You can put the file into a subdirectory if
you like. The subdirectory itself may have any name.

If you put the file in place before the run starts then Hesiod will pick it up. One day I'd
like to have this come from Ragic (or wherever).

If you put the file in after the fact you will have to re-run Hesiod, by removing the
`report.done` file from the `pipeline` directory. This will be quick because it only needs
to redo the report. Processing of the actual data is unaffected.

With run 20240125_EGS2_29490KG I did this but the sample names were not picked up.
Did I just make a typo, or is there some deeper issue? What's the quickest way to debug
the sample names lookup?

$ env ENVIRON_SH=~pipeline/hesiod/current/environ.sh ./sample_names_check.sh 20240125_EGS2_29490KG

So this helper script is helpful. In this case the error is:

error: Unable to parse line 2

So what did I do wrong in /lustre-gseg/promethion/sample_names/29490_sample_names.tsv?

Oh, I misspelt "barcode" as "barocde". Well, I'm just going to make the script tolerate that.
