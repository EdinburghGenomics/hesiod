At present, the .fast5 files are synced to PROM_RUNS by whatever RSYNC invocation is
set in the config, and then they are hard-linked to FASTQDATA when the run directory
is processed.

The problem is that the files end up like this:

-rw-rw-r-- 3 pipeline eg-pipeline 35357114 Oct 26 15:33 FAV38763_pass_barcode01_ca3b0fd6_0.fast5

And you can only hard-link to a file if you have write access, so currently deliveries are
falling abck to making copies.

As noted on ../smrtino/doc/edgen-smrtlink.epcc.ed.ac.uk.txt we really need reflinks, but it's not going
to happen on Lustre.

So my idea is that in Snakefile.rundata when the files are linked the group owner should also be changed.
Thsi will make the files writeable by the analysts but I think it's a small problem - accidental deletion
seems unlikely.
