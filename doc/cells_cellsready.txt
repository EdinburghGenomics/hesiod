In version 0.1.4 I pass a list of 'cells' and 'cellsready' into the Snakefile.

CELLS (as reported by run_status.py) is all the cells in this run
CELLSREADY (ditto) is all the cells now ready to process

BUT...

The report wants to collect up all the cells in the run, inlcuding the ones that were made
before. And these are not listed in CELLSREADY, so they do not go into SC, so they do not
go into the report and they get lost.

Hmmmm.

I could just add everything to SC, but then I'll need to differentiate between cells that
are not yet ready and those already processed. How about I look for cells where there is
already a cell_info.yml and just fold it into the report. This seems more like what I was after.
Also I should be able to run with an empty cellsready and still get a report. Yeah.

Er, no. That's going to get confusing and goes against the whole idea that Snakemake determines
what to process. Let's add CELLDONE to CELLSREADY when calling the Snakefile from the driver.
