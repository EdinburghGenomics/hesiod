Current flowcells are generating vast numbers of POD5 files.

For example, cell 125000635_G363873_1972_G003181315 produced 13000 pod5_pass files, which are about 100MB
each.

If we merged in batches of 100 files that are around 10GB each, we get 130 files. Much better!
Or maybe merge in batches of 40 files that are about 4GB each, and we get about 350.

$ pod5 merge ... # should do this nicely

OK, I think I'll arbitrarily pick 80 files. I can use a similar logic I already have for the
batched-up md5summing and the FASTQ merging.

The merging currently makes a per-batch md5sum file called batch{FAST5_BATCH_SIZE}_{b:08d}.md5.
I think the {b:08d} format should be replaced by a variable-width number dependent on the number of
batches rather than hard-coded to 08. Easy enough.

While I'm at it, I can completely remove the calref mapping feature, as we no longer add Lambda spike-in by
default! This will simplify the code a little.
