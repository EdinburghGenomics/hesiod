Urmi compressed all the reads into a file named:

all_pass_reads.fastq.gz

I think we should continue our standard that every data file we deliver is uniquely
identifiable by name even if it is removed from the context of the directory.

To this end, I propose:

{run}_{lib}_{cellid}_{pf}

cellid is like PAD53013
pf is pass or fail

Much like Illumina. Not like PacBio.
