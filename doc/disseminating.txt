We need to disseminate these files.

If we decide to always use 'experiment' to mean 'project' then finding the files
to send is pretty easy.

But we've not made that decision. We could use 'experiment' like 'run' - ie.
for all the cells loaded in a batch, which is kinda what I expect.

I feel that we should definitely fix the convention that the first component of
the cell name is the library, and the library starts with the project number. That
way I can avoid worrying about 'experiment'.

Problem is - would we ever multiplex multiple projects on a cell. How would that work?
Within a single project we just have a pool name and that's fine. But not for multiple.
Ask the lab!

I can have a projects_ready.txt file in any case, so I'll be able to scan for runs.
For now I can just write this the naive way. get_files_for_project will link both the
fastq and the fast5 dirs, but only the passed.
Modified version of pbflags etc should work.
Disseminate results will need to grow yet more tentacles. Oh well.

And all of this assumes we're not demultiplexing, but we'll come to that.

First job - put in projects_ready.txt
