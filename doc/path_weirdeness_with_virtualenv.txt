Note sent to Murray after funny behaviour trying to get friver.sh running
on clinical cluster.

Hi Murray,

I think I've worked out what was going on with the PATH when running
driver.sh the other day:

   1. You have a Virtual Env active which has set the PATH in your
      interactive shell
   2. When the driver.sh script starts under 'bash -l' it inherits $PATH
      but not the 'deactivate' alias
   3. Your .bashrc re-activates the virtual env and saves the old PATH
   4. My script tinkers with the PATH
   5. My script activates the new virtual env, which first deactivates the
      active one, restoring the old PATH (ie. from step 1) and clobbering
      the changes, before adding its own.

So that actually makes sense. The proper fix here is to not have "bash
-l" as the executable, and we should probably fix our CRON setup to
remove the need for it. In the short term I've just made sure all PATH
manipulation in driver.sh is done after the virtual env activation.

Cheers,

TIM
