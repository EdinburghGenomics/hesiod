Project 24970CE is one of these where an external user is using our Promethion.

They have been told to use the experiment name 24970CE but they have chosen
their own sample name, and there is nothing in the LIMS regarding samples.
But there is a LIMS project, which captures the name and customer e-mail.

This breaks automated delivery, but it shouldn't.

Let's fix this to make it work, since this will not be the last of these projects.

1) Edit get_np_yml.py to have a --by_experiment flag which ignores the projects_ready.txt
and just looks for runs by project name.

I'm not sure I like this. Maybe Hesiod could auto-generate projects_ready.txt in a different
way?

Yep, I've just made it more flexible to assume that it can get the project number out
of the experiment name.  Changes were made to hesiod.parse_cell_name()

And then I made a load of changes to nanopore_scripts and a couple of changes to
qc_tools_python and it looks like we should just be able to handle these without any
special flags, and without messing up the sanity cheching logic for the regular runs.

DONE!
