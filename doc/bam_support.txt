If a run is set up in MinKNOW to have BAM outputs then we'll get BAM files as well as the .fastq and .fast5

For the run 20221103_EGS2_25070AT I manually merged these using Picard tools:

$ picard-tools-2.27.2 MergeSamFiles --MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM 10000000 "${infiles[@]}" \
          -O "${outpath}/${name_prefix}_modbases_gpu_${barcode}_${pf}.bam"     \
          --MERGE_SEQUENCE_DICTIONARIES true --VALIDATION_STRINGENCY LENIENT --USE_THREADING true \
          --CREATE_INDEX false --ASSUME_SORTED true

This is fine but Picard can't take a FOFN as input plus we're already using samtools. So let's merge
with samtools instead. To make the equivalent command:

--MAX_RECORDS_IN_RAM : not needed
"${infiles[@]}" : -b fofn.txt
--MERGE_SEQUENCE_DICTIONARIES : (no -c or -p)
--VALIDATION_STRINGENCY : not needed
--USE_THREADING : -@ {threads}
--CREATE_INDEX : --write-index (leave this out)
--ASSUME_SORTED : -n (I think?)

--

OK, so it seems that I missed that samtools has a fast 'samtools cat' mode that combines BAM files without
recompressing them, and takes minutes instead of hours on large inputs. So we'll deffo switch to this.

I did look at the idea of re-packing all the individual BAM files prior to running samtools cat
to really save on space, and it looks like that could save around 10% (original file of size
12644884 re-packed to 11653856) but the extra time and complexity to do this is just not worth it.
