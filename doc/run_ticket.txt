We already have a queue 'bfx-promethion-run' and should be able to create tickets and send messages using the
existing rt_runticket_manager.py.

For testing, I can just send to the 'testing' queue on rt-test there's no need to make a new queue.

So what do I want to send, and when, and with what info:

Run starts - at present we don't have much info, and I'm not even sure if we'll necessarily see all the
cells at once on the first scan? But assuming we do I can make something similar to what I have for SMRTino,
showing the number of cells and the projects/libraries for each cell.

Run completes - unlike SMRTino we don't see that the run is complete until after the sync stage, but if the
pipeline is running prperly this should be quick. If not, I'll have to re-think the way I do things but for
now just go with the notification and wire it into RT.

All processing completes - it's possible in the world of Promethion that a new cell goes in while the previous
one is processing, so I could check for new stuff at the end of the QC phase, but this is a bit icky.
Instead, just determine up front if this is the 'final' report and if it is then send a 'Finished pipeline'
message, even if we immediately then start processing a new cell and are going to send another 'Finished'
message.

Aside from that, send a comment every time a we start making a report, and every time we upload a (partial)
report, and every time we auto-abort a stalled cell (if that ever becomes a thing).

What can we summarize? Before the initial sync we have very little to go on. Just the output from
list_remote_cells.sh, which gets put into RUNID and CELLS.
