I spent about 2 days trying to track down a weird intermittent bug with minionqc.

It turns out that R, or at least the library I'm using, hides disk-full errors
on /tmp, and of course the cluster nodes have a very small /tmp space.

I'd forgotten that the system version of Snakemake is configured to avoid this
and other problems, so while it may seem sensible to add snakemake to the
virtual env I'd advise against it. If you need a later version of Snakemake
and/or Python then install them system wide, apply the fixes, and use those.

I will note that while 3.11.2.patch2 is very old and does have a bug or two
it's hella stable for what we use it for!

Actually, on second thoughts, I do need to load custom modules (like yamlloader)
in my Snakemake code, so back to plan A. Just means I need to roll the Snakemake fixes
into Hesiod itself, by adding a wrapper in the toolbox. Fine.

Similar things are done for SMRTino and Illuminatus.
