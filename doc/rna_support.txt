So we have a run 20220316_EGS1_18701TK0002-0003 which is direct RNA. Therefor the FASTQ files have U instead of T.

But all is not well. Hesiod does nto like the U. Firstly this caused blobplot to fail because there was no
match to any species for any sequences. I switched the blobtools version in the toolbox to use my new version
that actually already addressed this (for SMRTino) so we should at least avoid a crash.

Next step is to modify the blob plotter to swith the U to T.

seqtk seq -ACNU wants to be -ACU (no N). There are generally (always??) no N bases in the ONT reads anyway.

Then, I think BLAST needs those U's changed to T's but let's see...

# We already have a sed cleanup step so can augment it like so:
sed -e 's,/,_,g' -e '/^>/!s/U/T/g'

No it turns out BLAST is happy with U's after all. OK, cool. It was just the trivial change to 'seqtk seq'
after all.

What about minimap2, as used to spot the lambda? It won't be obvious because we don't have any lambda in the RNA,
we use something else (from yeast??)

In the albacore source I find two files:

lambda_3.6kb.mmidx
yhr174w.mmidx

Presumably this second one is the RNA calibration strand. Do we see these same files in with GuPPY? Yep.
In fact they are the actual FASTA not the MM index files.

lambda_3.6kb.fasta
YHR174W.fasta

Cool. So really the pipeline should know if it is processing DNA or RNA. We can get this from the
final_summary_PAK01185_f579772a.txt file which we already parse to check the file counts.

protocol=sequencing/sequencing_PRO002_RNA:FLO-PRO002:SQK-RNA002

I think we can simply say that if the protocol matches /RNA/ we're doing RNA.

...


Finally, is minimap2 happy now or is it tripping up on those U's?
It's happy, but I think my naive parameter selection for minimap2 is mapping too much. I wish I could see what
parameters Guppy is using for minimap2 to get a good judgement of what is calibration read and what is a real
read.
I'll fix up what I have for now and revisit this later.
