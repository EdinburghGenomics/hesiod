At the moment, we have one Promethion instrument. What if we had more than one?

Well, we could set multiple values for UPSTREAM. And we could ensure that the
instrument name was added to the run by the same munging mechanism in
list_remote_cells.sh. That would be useful to incorporate now, I think.

Unlike the Illumina machines and the PacBio, the Promethion doesn't seem to
know it's own name, or at least does not incorporte this into the run names.
But it says "EGS-1" on the side so I'll call it "EGS1".

So instead of:

UPSTREAM=prom@promethion:/data

We have:

UPSTREAM="EGS1"
UPSTREAM_EGS1=prom@promethion:/data

Oh yeah.
