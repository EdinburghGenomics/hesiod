After updating Hesiod to handle RNA, we have another couple of requests:

1) Finally fix the naming convention. We'll use "Experiment" rather than "Run" because
that's what MinKNOW calls this thing. Caitlin is going to try grouping future runs
so that each Experiment is actually related to one project.

There's no sense in signing off batches of cells by "run" because the way that cells
are loade means there will be different conditions per cell - it's not like Illumina
where a fluidics issue can affect all the lanes.

As part of this, add the original experiment name to the metadata just to be explicit,
even though it's just the last part of the run ID in most cases.

What do I need to correct?

The RT queue will still be called "bfx-promethion-run" but I want the titles to be
"Experiment".

2) Add the PDF reports to the Hesiod report. I note that the files are provided in
both PDF and markdown format, so I might try re-rendering them as HTML or just copy the
PDF onto egloud and link it.
