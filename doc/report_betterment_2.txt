After updating Hesiod to handle RNA, we have another couple of requests:

1) Finally fix the naming convention. We'll use "Experiment" rather than "Run" because
that's what MinKNOW calls this thing. Caitlin is going to try grouping future runs
so that each Experiment is actually related to one project.

There's no sense in signing off batches of cells by "run" because the way that cells
are loaded means there will be different conditions per cell if multiple projects
are run at once - it's not like Illumina where a fluidics issue can affect all the lanes.

As part of this, add the original experiment name to the metadata just to be explicit,
even though it's just the last part of the run ID in most cases.

How to get this? 

What do I need to correct?

1)
The RT queue will still be called "bfx-promethion-run" but I want the titles to be
"Experiment". This required a change to the rt_runticket_manager, adding a --prefix
option.

I also want to chenge make_report. Pretty easy. I'll also change the name in the YAML,
but retain support for reporting old YAML files.

2) Add the PDF reports to the Hesiod report. I note that the files are provided in
both PDF and markdown format, so I might try re-rendering them as HTML or just copy the
PDF onto egloud and link it.

3) See for example ticket #14454 - Caitlin is pasting a load of numbers into a spreadsheet.
We can recreate this at the top of each Hesiod report. Confirm what numbers are actually
needed, as Caitlin says not all are relevant. Probably the percentage mapping to calib
strand is something we care about!
