At present, the pipeline splits all the 'pass' sequences into 2 files:

1) A BAM file of all the reads that aligned to lambda, aligned to lambda.
2) A FASTQ file of everything else

The blob plots now only show the latter. Which is good but also maybe we'd like to
see a version of the blob with the lambda present? Well if so we could just go
back to making the blob on all the 'pass' reads, but this:

1) Generates a whole extra big file, unless we rearrange the rules
2) Relies on BLAST to identify the lambda sequences

For 2 especially, if we switch to a synthetic spike-in then that won't be in NT.

So, we could do something programmatic. This would involve subsampling both the
FASTQ and the BAM at the corect percentages, then BLASTing only the FASTQ reads,
and synthesizing a BLAST report for the lambda reads. The we'd combine it all
and feed it to BLOBtools.

Yes this is doable. Probably pointless but doable. If we wanted to show both plots
for comparison then we could subsample the FASTQ reads post-blasting to avoid
repeat work. Hmmm.
